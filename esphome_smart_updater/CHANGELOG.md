## Version Numbering

- **Major (X.0.0):** Breaking changes, architecture changes
- **Minor (1.X.0):** New features, significant improvements
- **Patch (1.0.X):** Bug fixes, minor improvements

---

## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.x to 2.0

1. **Backup your configuration** (copy options to a text file)
2. **Uninstall the old version**
3. **Reinstall from repository** (new slug)
4. **Restore configuration**
5. **Ensure Protection Mode is OFF**
6. **Test with `dry_run: true` first**

The add-on slug has changed, so this requires a fresh installation.
