## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Fixed IP address extraction from ESPHome YAML configurations
  - Now properly detects IPs defined in substitution variables (e.g., `device_static_ip: "10.128.88.123"`)
  - Added support for inline manual_ip format (`manual_ip: 192.168.1.100`)
  - Added support for multi-line static_ip format (under `manual_ip:` block)
  - Added support for generic IP/address patterns in substitutions
  - Resolves issue where devices with static IPs were incorrectly falling back to mDNS resolution

### Improved
- **OTA Upload Reliability:**
  - Implements automatic fallback from static IP to mDNS if initial upload fails
  - Tries multiple upload targets intelligently (IP first, then mDNS)
  - Prevents duplicate upload attempts to the same target
  - Better error messages indicating which target failed and why

- **Logging Enhancements:**
  - Added device discovery summary showing count of static IP vs mDNS devices
  - Clearly indicates connection method being used for each device (static IP or mDNS)
  - Shows which upload target succeeded or failed during multi-target attempts
  - More descriptive progress messages during OTA operations

### Changed
- Updated device discovery logic to handle multiple IP address formats
- Improved target selection strategy with intelligent fallback behavior
- Enhanced upload process to be more resilient to network variations

### Technical Details
This release improves compatibility with diverse ESPHome configuration styles:
- **Substitution-based IPs** (common in large deployments): `device_static_ip: "10.x.x.x"`
- **Inline manual IPs**: `manual_ip: 192.168.1.100`
- **Block-style manual IPs**: `manual_ip:` with `static_ip:` on separate line
- **mDNS-only devices**: Automatic detection and fallback for devices without static IPs

### Compatibility
- Compatible with ESPHome 2025.11.0 and later
- Maintains backward compatibility with all 2.0.0 configurations
- No configuration changes required for upgrade

## Version Numbering

- **Major (X.0.0):** Breaking changes, architecture changes
- **Minor (1.X.0):** New features, significant improvements
- **Patch (1.0.X):** Bug fixes, minor improvements

---

## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.x to 2.0

1. **Backup your configuration** (copy options to a text file)
2. **Uninstall the old version**
3. **Reinstall from repository** (new slug)
4. **Restore configuration**
5. **Ensure Protection Mode is OFF**
6. **Test with `dry_run: true` first**

The add-on slug has changed, so this requires a fresh installation.
