# ESPHome Selective Updates

**Smart bulk updates for ESPHome devices - only updates devices that actually need it**

---

## 🎯 Why This Add-on Exists

### The Problem

ESPHome's built-in "Update All" button has a critical flaw:

- ❌ **No intelligence** - Recompiles ALL devices, even ones already updated
- ❌ **No resume** - If interrupted at device #200, starts over from #1
- ❌ **Wastes time** - Takes 10+ hours for 375 devices when only 5 need updates
- ❌ **No offline detection** - Tries to update unreachable devices and fails

### The Solution

This add-on fixes ESPHome's missing functionality:

- ✅ **Smart updates** - Only compiles devices where `deployed_version ≠ current_version`
- ✅ **Resume capability** - Picks up exactly where it left off if interrupted
- ✅ **Offline detection** - Pings devices first, skips unreachable ones
- ✅ **Progress tracking** - Detailed logging and state persistence
- ✅ **Efficiency** - 15 minutes instead of 10 hours for large deployments

**Real-world results:** Updates 375 devices in ~30 minutes instead of 10+ hours

---

## 🎓 Who Should Use This

### ✅ **This add-on is for you if:**
- You have **50+ ESPHome devices**
- You're tired of ESPHome's "Update All" blindly recompiling everything
- You understand basic Docker concepts
- You're comfortable with "advanced user" tools

### ❌ **Don't use this if:**
- You only have a handful of devices (just use ESPHome dashboard manually)
- You're uncomfortable with the Protection Mode requirement (see below)
- You want a "set and forget" solution (this requires understanding)

---

## ⚠️ Important: Protection Mode Requirement

### **This add-on requires Protection Mode to be turned OFF**

**Why:**
- This add-on extends ESPHome's functionality
- It needs to compile firmware inside the ESPHome container
- This requires Docker socket access, which Protection Mode blocks

**Is this safe?**

Yes, because this add-on:
- ✅ **Only accesses the ESPHome add-on container** (not your host system)
- ✅ **Only reads/writes `/config/esphome/`** (same as ESPHome does)
- ✅ **Uses the same tools ESPHome uses** (esphome CLI, PlatformIO)
- ✅ **Doesn't access other containers** or privileged host resources
- ✅ **Open source** - you can audit the entire codebase

**What it does NOT do:**
- ❌ Does not access your Home Assistant container
- ❌ Does not modify system files
- ❌ Does not access other add-ons
- ❌ Does not expose network services
- ❌ Does not run background services

### How to Disable Protection Mode

1. Go to **Add-ons → ESPHome Selective Updates → Info tab**
2. Find **"Protection mode"** toggle
3. Turn it **OFF**
4. Restart the add-on

**Note:** This is a documented limitation until ESPHome adds a native compile API (which we're requesting - see below).

## 🛠️ Usage

### Manual Button Script

Create a button in Home Assistant:

```yaml
type: button
tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: hassio.addon_start
  data:
    addon: local_esphome_selective_updates
name: Update ESPHome Devices
icon: mdi:chip
```

### Scheduled Nightly Update

```yaml
alias: ESPHome Nightly Update
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "21:00:00"
action:
  - service: hassio.addon_start
    data:
      addon: local_esphome_selective_updates
```

### Input Boolean Trigger

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.esphome_update_trigger
    to: "on"
action:
  - service: hassio.addon_start
    data:
      addon: local_esphome_selective_updates
  - delay: 5
  - service: input_boolean.turn_off
    target:

```

### Dry Run First (Recommended)

Before your first real run:

1. Set `dry_run: true` in options
2. Start the add-on
3. Review logs to see what would be updated
4. Set `dry_run: false` when satisfied
5. Run for real

```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### Compilation Process

1. Uses `docker exec` to run ESPHome CLI inside the official ESPHome add-on
2. Compiles firmware: `esphome compile /config/esphome/<device>.yaml`
3. Locates compiled `.bin` file in container
4. Copies binary to `/config/esphome/builds/` on host
5. Performs OTA upload via `esphome upload` command

### Smart Update Logic

```python
for device in all_devices:
    deployed_version = dashboard.json["device"]["deployed_version"]
    current_version  = dashboard.json["device"]["current_version"]
    
    if deployed_version == current_version:
        skip(device)  # Already up-to-date
    else:
        update(device)  # Needs update
```

### Resume Capability

Progress is tracked in `/config/esphome_update_progress.json`:

```json
{
  "done": ["ai001", "ai002", "ai003"],
  "failed": ["as007"],
  "skipped": ["offline-device"]
}
```

If the add-on is stopped or crashes, the next run will:
- Skip devices in "done" array
- Retry devices in "failed" array
- Re-evaluate devices in "skipped" array

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `FATAL: Docker socket not found` | Protection Mode is ON | Turn OFF Protection Mode in add-on Info tab |
| `ESPHome container not found` | Container name incorrect | Check actual name in Supervisor logs, update config |
| `Cannot communicate with Docker` | Protection Mode or socket issue | Ensure Protection Mode is OFF, restart add-on |
| Devices skipped | They were offline or already updated | Check logs for skip reasons |
| Compilation failed | YAML syntax error or missing dependencies | Check device YAML in ESPHome dashboard |
| OTA upload failed | Device offline, wrong password, or network issue | Check device reachability and OTA password |

### Common ESPHome Container Names

If `addon_15ef4d2f_esphome` doesn't work, try:
- `addon_a0d7b954_esphome`
- `addon_5c53de3b_esphome`

To find your actual container name:
1. Go to **Settings → System → Logs**
2. Select **Supervisor**
3. Look for "Starting addon_XXXXXXXX_esphome"

### Viewing Progress File

```bash
cat /config/esphome_update_progress.json
```

To manually reset progress:
```yaml
clear_progress_now: true
```
(Remember to set it back to `false` after)

---

## 🔧 Advanced Use Cases

### Update Only Specific Devices

```yaml
update_only_these:
  - ai001
  - ai002
  - as007
```

### Batch Updates (Test on 5 devices first)

```yaml
max_devices_per_run: 5
```

Run multiple times to process all devices in batches.

### Resume from Specific Device

```yaml
start_from_device: "ai150"
```

Useful if you want to manually control where to start.

### Nightly Updates with Notification

```yaml
alias: ESPHome Nightly Update with Notification
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "02:00:00"
action:
  - service: hassio.addon_start
    data:
      addon: local_esphome_selective_updates
  - delay: 300  # Wait 5 minutes for completion
  - service: notify.mobile_app
    data:
      title: "ESPHome Updates"
      message: "Nightly device updates completed. Check add-on logs for details."
```

## 📡 Network Requirements

- Access to ESPHome dashboard container (local Docker)
- Access to device IPs for HTTP OTA (ports 3232, 8266, or 6053)
- Supervisor Docker socket (`/run/docker.sock`)

---

## Feature Request to ESPHome

I've submitted a feature request to make this functionality native 
to ESPHome Dashboard:

https://github.com/orgs/esphome/discussions/3382

If you'd like to see this become an official ESPHome feature, 
please 👍 the discussion and share your use case!

Until then, this add-on provides the functionality you need today.
If ESPHome adds a compile API, I'll refactor this add-on to use it and make Protection Mode unnecessary.
